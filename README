NAME
	dlu - Dictionary lookup utility

SYNOPSIS
	dlu (-l | dictionary word)

DESCRIPTION
	dlu looks up a selected word in a selected scanned dictionary.

	dlu is configured via ~/.config/dlu/dlurc, a Python 3 file
	which defines the functions:

	list_dictionaries()
		Returns a list of all dictionaries.

	load_dictionary(dictionary : str) -> bool
		Sets the fuction get() or a variable that get() reads
		to identify which dictionary has been selected. The
		function shall return True if the dictionary exists,
		and False otherwise.

	open_dictionary(file : str, page : int)
		Opens the specified page in the specified file.

		The default implementation opens atril(1), evince(1),
		xpdf(1), or jfbview(1) to display the specified file
		and page.

	wordmod(word : str) -> str
		Modifies and returns a word so that it can be used
		to compare against known words in the dictionary.

		The default implemention of this function covers the
		word to lower case using Python's string class's
		lower() function.

	get() -> tuple
		Returns a 3-tuple containing, in order: the filename
		of the scanned dictionary, a list of the last word on
		each page, and a int-to-int function that maps the
		index of a word, in the list in the second element of
		the returned tuple, to a page in the dictionary.

OPTIONS
	-l	Print a list of all dictionaries.

FILES
	~/.config/dlu/dlurc
